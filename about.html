            <p>First, let me take a second to just send you my thanks for taking a little time to find out more about me.</p>
            <p>So...Who is Brett Burdick?</p>
            <p>I am a California native, who grew up as an "Air Force brat". My father was acive-duty for 23 years, which meant we moved quite a bit. I actually attended 13 different schools before finally graduating high school. Needless to say, being able to adapt to change was an essential quality I learned early on, as well as making friends.</p>
            <p>Throughout my adolescent years I was always tinkering with computers. I usually got the "hand-me-down" PC after my father bought a new one...starting with a Commodore 64.<span> </span><i class="ion-happy-outline"></i> Hardware fascinated me...it was a perpetual hobby to make my computer better and faster.</p>
            <p>Upon graduating high school, I followed in my father's footsteps and joined the Air Force. I scored very well on the ASVAB, allowing me to choose pretty much any job I desired. I chose the path of computers and enlisted with the job of Computer Networking, Crypto and Switching Systems. My four years serving my country taught me a lot and, without a doubt, shaped me into the person I am today. After two tours of duty following the terroist attacks of 09/11 I was honored with the Air Force Achievement Medal and a National Defense ribbon, but the experience had taken it's toll and I made the decision to exit the military and persue life as a civilian.</p>
            <p>Life for me after military service began my career in the food industry, which was very rewarding in the fact that I met many differnet people from all walks of life. I discovered quickly, to be a great salesman involved earning the trust of my guests. This quality came easily, I believe due to the fact I was raised to have integrity and simply treat others as you would want them to treat you. After just over a decade in this industry, while attempting to aquire a college degree on three seperate occasions, I felt as if my life had hit a road block. I needed a change.</p>
            <p>While deciding on which path to take in my career change, I came across the profession of web development. After reading about so many success stories from graduates of coding bootcamps, my interest grew quickly. I immediately set goals to position myself in a school with a proven track record.</p>
            <p>Enter <a href="http://www.digitalcrafts.com" target="_blank">DigitalCrafts</a>: </br>Since the very first day in my journey on becomming a web developer, I have never felt so sure about anything. Creating projects, and learning new languages and frameworks has been EXCITING to say the least. It kind of makes me feel young again, starting my day with a desire to write code and build awesome projects that solve complex problems. It has been reminiscent of my days building computers. This sort of pleasure and spirit was absent for too long!</p>
            <p>At the moment, I eat, breathe, and sleep code. Of course this is not the only thing I am passionate about in life. My wife truly is my "better half". Without the love and support she gives everyday, none of this would ever be possible. If I am not grinding out lines of code, you can bet I am just enjoying life with her, or watching my sports teams dominate. It has been a rough ride for...uh...my whole life being a Chicago Cubs fan. That deprivation of victory ends in 2016! EAMUS CATULI</p>
